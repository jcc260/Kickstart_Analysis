# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

    The overview of this project is to utilize excel tools such as formulas, charts and pivot tables to set an accurate picture with manipulating data. These tools can used in all aspects of life such as household budgeting to intricate financial analysis. We are going to hone these skills to help Lousie start a crowdfunding campaign for her play "Fever". 

### Purpose

    The purpose of this project is to make sure that Lousie does not go over her budget of $10,000. We used excel to organize, sort and analyze large groups of data. We determined through formulas, charts and pivot tables, why some campaigns were a failire and why others were successful. Based to on those factors, we will build a criteria for Louise to follow so that she can have a successful crowdfunding campaign for her play "Fever".

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

I performed my analysis by extracting the data to form a pivot table and line graph to determine the theater outcomes by launch date. Based on the data and the graph, the best time to lauch is during the warmer months(May, June, July and Aug). This can be do to the fact that people are will to spend more during the summer. Anoter outcome is the peak month to lauch the campaign is May, this will increase the percentage for Lousie's play "Fever to be successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

I also used the countif and sum function to determine which campaign was a success and failure based on their goal amount that they wanted to raise. I used that data to create a line graph so the data can be easy to visualize. When the goals were between 45,000 - 49,999, it had a 100% failure rate. The most consist success rate was betwwen 35,000 - 44,999. Failure rate is also the lowest between those ranges as well. These are the target prices that Louise should be aiming for when getting funding for her play.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

A challenges that I encountered was the countif function and using it correctly so that the line graph made sense to read. I overcame this by doing research through google and looking at youtube videos. I was eventually able to organize the data to give to Lousie.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The best time to launch is in May and the worst time is in December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

When the goal range is between 45,000-49,000, the failure rate is 100% and the best success rate is between 35,000-44,999 with a 67% success rate and 33% failure rate.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

One of the limits to this data is that it is not that recent. The most recent set of data is 2017. Human behavior, marketing and the econmy change within 5 years. We need more recent data to break down.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We can also create a pie graph to show better percentages. Also a bar graph would be perfect way to visualize more data on a single gragh. You can add more elements to the graph without it being hard to read and cluttered.
